# Angler's Arrows — Fish Arrow Puzzles

A calm, offline-first PWA puzzle. **Every level is a fish built entirely out of arrow tiles.**
Tap an arrow to send it swimming off the board — it only leaves if its straight-line path to
the edge is clear. Clear all the arrows and the fish's true colors surface underneath, along
with the species name, scientific name, and a fact about it.

Inspired in mechanic by "arrow maze" games, reworked so the picture *is* the puzzle: the fish
silhouette is the board.

## How it works
- Each fish is a hand-built parametric SVG. On load it's rasterized in the browser into a small
  grid of colored cells — that fish-shaped set of cells becomes the board.
- Arrows are placed by **reverse construction**: each arrow is added only when it has a clear ray
  to the edge over the arrows already placed. Removing them in reverse order is always possible,
  so **every puzzle is guaranteed solvable and can never deadlock**, no matter the tap order.
- Arrows are **variable-length pieces** (1–5 cells) with a single arrowhead, drawn as bold rounded
  strokes on a light dotted board — the professional "arrow maze" look. Clearing a piece slides it
  off and uncovers the fish's real colors beneath it.
- Difficulty ramps by growing the fish's grid width across the 12 species (≈15 → ≈35 arrow pieces).


## Learning the fish (the point of it)
Angler's Arrows is meant to help anglers recognize species by sight. When you clear a puzzle,
the completion card shows the fish in full color with a **"How to know it"** list of field marks —
the defining features you'd use to identify it on the water — plus its common and scientific name.
Everything you've landed is saved in the **Field Guide** (top-right), so you can review the species
and their features any time. The completion card waits for you: study the fish, then tap **Next fish**.

## Files
- `index.html` — the whole game (no dependencies, works offline)
- `manifest.webmanifest` — installable PWA metadata
- `service-worker.js` — offline cache (`anglers-arrows-v1`)
- `icons/` — app icons generated from the Angler's Arrows logo
- `logo_src.png` — the source logo

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Put these files at the repo root (or `/docs`).
2. Settings → Pages → deploy from that branch/folder.
3. Visit the URL on a phone and "Add to Home Screen" to install it.

Must be served over **https** (GitHub Pages is) for the service worker and install to work.

## Extend it
- **Add a species:** append to the `FISH[]` array with a `spec` for `fishSVG()`
  (body `a`/`b`, colors, `tail`, `pattern`, fins, `spikes`, `bill`). It's picked up automatically.
- **Tune difficulty:** edit `levelWidth(i)` (grid width per level).
- **Ideas:** sound, freshwater vs saltwater packs, a move "par" / star rating, daily fish.
